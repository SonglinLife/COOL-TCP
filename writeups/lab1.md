Lab 1 Writeup
=============

My name: Ariel

My SUNet ID: :(

I collaborated with: none

I would like to thank/reward these classmates for their help: none

This lab took me about 4 hours to do. I did not attend the lab session.

Program Structure and Design of the StreamReassembler:

Use a set (rb-tree) to store the unassembled segments.
This is because we want to assemble bytes with the least index first.
Always check and merge these segments to the byte-stream once available.

Implementation Challenges:

Understanding all tasks at once

Remaining Bugs:

You tell

- Optional: I had unexpected difficulty with: debugging unsafe code

- Optional: I think you could make this lab better by: it's already a perfection

- Optional: I was surprised by: the useful data structure I implemented

- Optional: I'm not sure about: none
